**Work in Progress....**

TermBattle is a multiplayer terminal-based game, where players can battle each other in real-time through the command line interface. The game is currently under development, and I am actively working on adding features and improving gameplay.

## About This Project

I'm having a lot of fun developing **TermBattle**, and it's giving me a way to learn more about things I am interested in, including: 
- **Server/Client Connections:** Building an efficient communication system between a server and multiple clients to ensure smooth real-time interactions.
- **TCP Protocol:** Implementing reliable data transmission using TCP to handle the complexities of real-time multiplayer gaming.
- **Game Logic:** Designing and implementing the core mechanics that make battles strategic and engaging for players.
- **Databases:** Utilizing SQL and NoSQL systems, including PostgreSQL, to efficiently manage and store persistent server data.
