# TermBattle Multiplayer Game

**Work in Progress....**

TermBattle is a multiplayer terminal-based game inspired by **Pok√©mon**, where players can battle each other in real-time through the command line interface. The game is currently under development, and I am actively working on adding features and improving gameplay.
